        "\n# UMAP as a Feature Extraction Technique for Classification\n\nThe following script shows how UMAP can be used as a feature extraction\ntechnique to improve the accuracy on a classification task. It also shows\nhow UMAP can be integrated in standard scikit-learn pipelines.\n\nThe first step is to create a dataset for a classification task, which is\nperformed with the function ``sklearn.datasets.make_classification``. The\ndataset is then split into a training set and a test set using the\n``sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`` function.\n\nSecond, a linear SVM is fitted on the training set. To choose the best\nhyperparameters automatically, a gridsearch is performed on the training set.\nThe performance of the model is then evaluated on the test set with the\naccuracy metric.\n\n Third, the previous step is repeated with a slight modification: UMAP is\n used as a feature extraction technique. This small change results in a\n substantial improvement compared to the model where raw data is used.\n"
