<h1>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Compiled here are a set of frequently asked questions,
along with answers. If you don’t find your question listed here
then please feel free to add an
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/new">issue on github</a>.
More questions are always welcome, and the authors will do
their best to answer. If you feel you have a common question
that isn’t answered here then please suggest that the question
(and answer) be added to the FAQ when you file the issue.</p>
<section id="should-i-normalise-my-features">
<h2>Should I normalise my features?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-i-normalise-my-features" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The default answer is yes, but, of course, the real answer is
“it depends”. If your features have meaningful relationships
with one another (say, latitude and longitude values) then
normalising per feature is not a good idea. For features that
are essentially independent it does make sense to get all the
features on (relatively) the same scale. The best way to do
this is to use
<a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html">pre-processing tools from scikit-learn</a>.
All the advice given there applies as sensible preprocessing
for UMAP, and since UMAP is scikit-learn compatible you
can put all of this together into a <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html">scikit-learn pipeline</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-i-cluster-the-results-of-umap">
<h2>Can I cluster the results of UMAP?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-cluster-the-results-of-umap" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is hard to answer well, but essentially the answer is
“yes, with care”. To start with it matters what clustering
algorithm you are going to use. Since UMAP does not necessarily
produce clean spherical clusters something like K-Means
is a poor choice. I would recommend
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a> or
similar. The catch here is that UMAP, with its uniform density
assumption, does not preserve density well. What UMAP will do,
however, is contract connected components of the manifold
together. Providing you have enough data for UMAP to
distinguish that information then you can get <em>useful</em>
clustering results out since algorithms like HDBSCAN will
easily pick out the components after applying UMAP.</p>
<p>UMAP does offer significant improvements over algorithms
like t-SNE for clustering. First, by preserving more
global structure and creating meaningful separation
between connected components of the manifold on which
the data lies, UMAP offers more meaningful clusters.
Second, because it supports arbitrary embedding
dimensions, UMAP allows embedding to larger dimensional
spaces that make it more amenable to clustering.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-clusters-are-all-squashed-together-and-i-can-t-see-internal-structure">
<h2>The clusters are all squashed together and I can’t see internal structure<a class="headerlink" href="#the-clusters-are-all-squashed-together-and-i-can-t-see-internal-structure" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>One of UMAPs goals is to have distance between clusters of points
be meaningful. This means that clusters can end up spread out
with a fair amount of space between them. As a result the
clusters themselves can end up more visually packed together
than in, say, t-SNE. This is intended. A catch, however, is
that many plots (for example matplotlib’s scatter plot with
default parameters) tend to show the clusters only as indistinct
blobs with no internal structure. The solution for this is
really a matter of tuning the plot more than anything else.</p>
<p>If you are using matplotlib consider using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> parameter
that specifies the glyph size in scatter plots. Depending on
how much data you have reducing this to anything from 5 to
0.001 can have a notable effect. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code> parameter in
bokeh is similarly useful (but does not need to be quite so small).</p>
<p>More generally the real solution, particular with large datasets,
is to use <a class="reference external" href="http://datashader.org/">datashader</a> for plotting.
Datashader is a plotting library that handles aggregation
of large scale data in scatter plots in a way that can better
show the underlying detail that can otherwise be lost. We
highly recommend investing the time to learn datashader for
UMAP plot particularly for larger datasets.</p>

<section id="i-ran-out-of-memory-help">
<h2>I ran out of memory. Help!<a class="headerlink" href="#i-ran-out-of-memory-help" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For some datasets the default options for approximate
nearest neighbor search can result in excessive memory use.
If your dataset is not especially large but you have found
that UMAP runs out of memory when operating on it consider
using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">low_memory=True</span></code> option, which will switch
to a slower but less memory intensive approach to computing
the approximate nearest neighbors. This may alleviate your
issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="umap-is-eating-all-my-cores-help">
<h2>UMAP is eating all my cores. Help!<a class="headerlink" href="#umap-is-eating-all-my-cores-help" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If run without a random seed UMAP will use numba’s parallel
implementation to do multithreaded work and use many cores.
By default this will make use of as many cores as are available.
If you are on a shared machine or otherwise don’t wish to
use <em>all</em> the cores at once you can restrict the number of
threads that numba uses by making use of the environment
variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NUMBA_NUM_THREADS</span></code>; see the <a class="reference external" href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/envvars.html#threading-control">numba
documentation</a>
for more details.</p>

<section id="is-there-gpu-or-multicore-cpu-support">
<h2>Is there GPU or multicore-CPU support?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-gpu-or-multicore-cpu-support" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is basic multicore support as of version 0.4.
In the future it is possible that GPU support may
be added.</p>
<p>There is a UMAP implementation for GPU available in
the NVIDIA RAPIDS cuML library, so if you need GPU
support that is currently the best place to go.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-i-add-a-custom-loss-function">
<h2>Can I add a custom loss function?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-add-a-custom-loss-function" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To allow for fast performance the SGD phase of UMAP has
been hand-coded for the specific needs of UMAP. This makes
custom loss functions a little difficult to handle. Now
that Numba (as of version 0.38) supports passing functions
it is possible that future versions of UMAP may support
such functionality. In the meantime you should definitely
look into <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jlmelville/smallvis">smallvis</a>,
a library for t-SNE, LargeVis, UMAP, and related algorithms.
Smallvis only works for small datasets, but provides
much greater flexibility and control.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-there-support-for-the-r-language">
<h2>Is there support for the R language?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-support-for-the-r-language" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Yes! A number of people have worked hard to make UMAP
available to R users.</p>
<p>If you want to use the reference
implementation under the hood but want a nice R interface
then we recommend <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkonopka/umap">umap</a>,
which wraps the python code with
<a class="reference external" href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a>.
Another reticulate interface is
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/umapr">umapr</a>, but it
may not be under active development.</p>
<p>If you want a pure R version then we recommend
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot">uwot</a> at this time.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkonopka/umap">umap</a> also provides
a pure R implementation in addition to its reticulate
wrapper.</p>
<p>Both umap and uwot are available on CRAN.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-there-a-c-c-implementation">
<h2>Is there a C/C++ implementation?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-a-c-c-implementation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Not that we are aware of. For now Numba has done a very
admirable job of providing high performance and the
developers of UMAP have not felt the need to move to
lower level languages. At some point a multithreaded
C++ implementation may be made available, but there are
no time-frames for when that would happen.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-can-t-get-umap-to-run-properly">
<h2>I can’t get UMAP to run properly!<a class="headerlink" href="#i-can-t-get-umap-to-run-properly" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are, inevitably, a number of issues and corner cases
that can cause issues for UMAP. Some know issues that can
cause problems are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>UMAP doesn’t currently support 32-bit Windows.
This is due to issues with Numba of that platform
and will not likely be resolved soon. Sorry :-(</p></li>
<li><p>If you have pip installed the package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap</span></code>
at any time (instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap-learn</span></code>) this can
cause serious issues. You will want to purge/remove
everything umap related in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></code>
directory and re-install <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap-learn</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Having any files called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap.py</span></code> in the current
directory you will have issues as that will be
loaded instead of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap</span></code> module.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth checking the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues">issues page on github</a>
for potential solutions. If all else fails please add an

<h2>What is the difference between PCA / UMAP / VAEs?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-pca-umap-vaes" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is an example of an embedding for a popular Fashion MNIST dataset.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that FMNIST is mostly a toy dataset (MNIST on steroids).
On such a simplistic case UMAP shows distillation results
(i.e. if we use its embedding in a downstream task like classification)
comparable to VAEs, which are more computationally expensive.</p>
<p>By definition:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PCA is linear transformation, you can apply it
to mostly any kind of data in an unsupervised fashion.
Also it works really fast. For most real world tasks
its embeddings are mostly too simplistic / useless.</p></li>
<li><p>VAE is a kind of encoder-decoder neural network,
trained with KLD loss and BCE (or MSE) loss
to enforce the resulting embedding to be continuous.
VAE is an extension of auto-encoder networks,
which by design should produce embeddings that are
not only relevant to actually encoding the data, but are
also smooth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From a more practical standpoint:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PCA mostly works for any reasonable dataset on a modern machine.
(up to tens or hundreds of millions of rows);</p></li>
<li><p>VAEs have been shown to work only for toy datasets
and to our knowledge there was no real life useful application to
a real world sized dataset (i.e. ImageNet);</p></li>
<li><p>Applying UMAP to real world tasks usually provides a good starting
point for downstream tasks (data visualization, clustering, classification)
and works reasonably fast;</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a typical pipeline: high-dimensional embedding (300+)
=&gt; PCA to reduce to 50 dimensions =&gt; UMAP to reduce to 10-20 dimensions
=&gt; HDBSCAN for clustering / some plain algorithm for classification;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which tool should I use?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PCA for very large or high dimensional datasets (or maybe consider finding
a domain specific matrix factorization technique, e.g. topic modelling for texts);</p></li>
<li><p>UMAP for smaller datasets;</p></li>
<li><p>VAEs are mostly experimental;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Where can I learn more?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>While PCA is ubiquitous, you may <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/snakers4/playing_with_vae">look</a>
at this example comparing PCA / UMAP / VAEs;</p></li>

<section id="how-umap-can-go-wrong">
<h2>How UMAP can go wrong<a class="headerlink" href="#how-umap-can-go-wrong" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>One way UMAP can go wrong is the introduction of data points that are maximally far apart
from all other points in your data set.  In other words, a points nearest neighbour is maximally
far from it.  A common example of this could be a point which shares no features in common
with any other point under a Jaccard distance or a point whose nearest neighbour is np.inf from
it under a continuous distance function.  In both these cases UMAPs assumption of all points
lying on a connected manifold can lead us astray.  From this points perspective all other points
are equally valid nearest neighbours so its k-nearest neighbour query will return a random
selection of neighbours all at this maximal distance.  Next we will normalize this distance by
applying our UMAP kernel which says that a point should be maximally similar to it’s nearest neighbour.
Since all k-nearest neighbours are identically far apart they will all be considered maximally
similar by our point in question.  When we try to embed our data into a low dimensional space
our optimization will attempt to pull all these randomly selected points together.  Add a
sufficiently large number of these points and our entire space gets pulled together destroying
any of the structure we had hoped to identify.</p>
<p>To circumvent this problem we’ve added a disconnection_distance parameter to UMAP which will cut
any edge with a distance greater than the value passed in.  This parameter defaults to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.
When set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> the disconnection_distance will be set to the maximal value for any of our
supported bounded metrics and otherwise set to np.inf.  Removing these edges from the UMAP graph
will disconnect our manifold and cause these points to start where they are initialized and get pushed
away from all other points via the our optimization.</p>
<p>If a user has a good understanding of their distance metric they can set this value by hand to prevent
data in particularly sparse regions of their space from becoming connected to their manifold.</p>
<p>If vertices in your graph are disconnected a warning message will be thrown.  At that point a user can
make use of the umap.utils.disconnected_vertices() function to identify the disconnected points.
This can be used either for filtering and retraining a new UMAP model or simple to bed used as a
filter for visualization purposes as seen below.</p>
